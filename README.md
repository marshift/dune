# dune
templating engine and static site generator using [KDL](//kdl.dev)

## compatibility
dune is intended to run in every modern JS environment - including the web. currently, only ESM builds are emitted.
it uses `pnpm` as its package manager, so lockfiles other than `pnpm-lock.yaml` are ignored by Git.
